# DeckMaster
## Okay ! The name seem cool, but what is it exactly ?
DeckMaster is an electrical control platform that integrates an interactive screen to manage and control various
applications as Spotify, and other. This solution centralizes and simplifies the management of your multimedia experience
by providing convenient and intuitive control on a dedicated screen.

## Spotify is the only software I can manage ?
No, DeckMaster will have her own application, DeckStore. It's the official store of the DeckMaster ! You will find some
modules as long we will be free to developping it !

## DeckMaster is available for sell ?
Unfortunaly, no at this moment. This project has begun the 2023/06. But don't worry, you will be prevent when it will be
available ! (A link to specify your mail will be share !)
